Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

Therefore, the transformer\n        instance given to the pipeline cannot be inspected\n        directly.

By default,\n        no caching is performed. If a string is given, it is the path to\n        the caching directory. Enabling caching triggers a clone of\n        the transformers before fitting. Therefore, the transformer\n        instance given to the pipeline cannot be inspected\n        directly. Use the attribute ``named_steps`` or ``steps`` to\n        inspect estimators within the pipeline. Caching the\n        transformers is advantageous when fitting is time consuming.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    named_steps : bunch object, a dictionary with attribute access\n        Read-only attribute to access any step parameter by user given name.\n        Keys are step names and values are steps parameters.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline : convenience function for simplified\n        pipeline construction.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> from sklearn import svm\n    >>> from sklearn.datasets import samples_generator\n    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest\n    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression\n    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n    >>> #

This is useful to combine\n    several feature extraction mechanisms into a single transformer.\n\n    Parameters of the transformers may be set using its name and the parameter\n    name separated by a '__'. A transformer may be replaced entirely by\n    setting the parameter with its name to another transformer,\n    or removed by setting to 'drop' or ``None``.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <feature_union>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    transformer_list : list of (string, transformer) tuples\n        List of transformer objects to be applied to the data. The first\n        half of each tuple is the name of the transformer.\n\n    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)\n        Number of jobs to run in parallel.\n        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.\n        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    transformer_weights : dict, optional\n        Multiplicative weights for features per transformer.\n        Keys are transformer names, values the weights.\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    sklearn.pipeline.make_union : convenience function for simplified\n        feature union construction.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\n    >>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA, TruncatedSVD\n    >>> union = FeatureUnion([(\"pca\", PCA(n_components=1)),\n    ...
